# Board Orientation Fix - 2025-09-30

## Problem
Both players (white and black) were seeing the chess board from white's perspective. The black player should see the board flipped (from black's perspective).

## Root Cause
The game status check in `PlayMultiplayer.js` was blocking execution for games with "waiting" status:

```javascript
if (data.status !== 'active') {
  // ... early return
}
```

This prevented the board orientation setup code from running because:
- New games start with status "waiting"
- Only when both players join does status change to "active"
- The black player (acceptor) would hit this check and return early
- Board orientation setup code (lines 111-133) never executed
- Board defaulted to 'white' orientation (initial state)

## Solution
Modified the status check to allow both "waiting" and "active" statuses:

```javascript
if (data.status !== 'active' && data.status !== 'waiting') {
  // ... early return only for truly finished games
}
```

## Files Changed
- `chess-frontend/src/components/play/PlayMultiplayer.js:99`

## Verification
- Backend was already correctly sending `player_color: "black"` to User 2
- Backend was correctly assigning `white_player_id: 1` and `black_player_id: 2`
- After fix, both players see correct board orientation
- White player sees board from white's perspective (bottom)
- Black player sees board from black's perspective (bottom)

## Technical Details
The debugging process revealed:
1. Database assignments were correct
2. Laravel backend calculation was correct
3. API response included correct `player_color` field
4. Frontend was receiving correct data
5. Issue was in conditional logic preventing state updates

## Impact
- ✅ Correct board orientation for both players
- ✅ Better user experience for online multiplayer
- ✅ Proper game initialization for "waiting" status games
