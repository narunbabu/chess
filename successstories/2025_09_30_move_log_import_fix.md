# Move Broadcasting Fix - Missing Log Import - 2025-09-30

## Problem
When players tried to make moves, the backend returned a 500 Internal Server Error:
```
POST http://localhost:8000/api/websocket/games/1/move 500 (Internal Server Error)
```

## Root Cause
The `GameRoomService.php` file was using the `Log` facade at line 623:
```php
Log::info('Fallback analysis (no client hint)', ['game_id' => $game->id, 'analysis' => $analysis]);
```

But the `Log` facade import was missing from the top of the file, causing PHP to look for a non-existent class `App\Services\Log` instead of using the Laravel Log facade.

**Error from Laravel logs:**
```
Class "App\Services\Log" not found at
C:\ArunApps\Chess-Web\chess-backend\app\Services\GameRoomService.php:623
```

## Solution
Added the missing import statement at the top of `GameRoomService.php`:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;
```

## Files Changed
- `chess-backend/app/Services/GameRoomService.php` - Added Log facade import

## Impact
- ✅ Move broadcasting now works correctly
- ✅ Game state synchronization functional
- ✅ Players can make moves and see updates in real-time
- ✅ Proper logging for fallback game analysis

## Technical Notes
This was a simple missing import that prevented the entire move broadcasting system from working. The move validation and game state analysis were running successfully, but the error occurred during the logging phase after the analysis, causing the entire request to fail with a 500 error.
