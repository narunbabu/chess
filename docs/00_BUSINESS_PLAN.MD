  📞 Questions for You

  To refine this plan further, I'd like to know:

  1. Budget Commitment: How much can you invest in first 6 months? (₹50K, ₹1L, ₹2L+?)
  2. Time Availability: Can you dedicate full-time or part-time? Any co-founder?
  3. Technical Priority: Should we complete AI (Stockfish) before monetization, or monetize first?   
  4. Target Geography: Focus on specific cities first or pan-India?
  5. Risk Tolerance: Aggressive growth with higher CAC or conservative organic focus?
  6. Personal Network: Realistic estimate of initial users you can activate (50? 100? 200?)

  This comprehensive business plan gives you a clear roadmap from where you are today (working platform) to a
  sustainable chess business. The key is starting small, validating the model, then scaling what works!

  Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or help you with immediate execution items like creating
  the pricing page, payment integration, or marketing materials?
