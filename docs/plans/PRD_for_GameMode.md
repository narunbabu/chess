---

**UI Label**

---

## 5. Performance Evaluation System

### 5.1 Core Philosophy

* A **good loss** should feel rewarding
* A **careless win** should not inflate rating
* Encourage thinking, not grinding

---

### 5.2 Performance Metrics

#### Engine-Based (Primary)

| Metric            | Description                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Move Accuracy (%) | Closeness to engine best moves |
| Blunders          | Evaluation drop > 2.0          |
| Mistakes          | Evaluation drop 0.7–2.0        |
| Inaccuracies      | Evaluation drop 0.3–0.7        |
| ACPL              | Average centipawn loss         |

#### Time Management (Secondary)

* Time trouble errors (light penalty)
* Flag loss (partial penalty only)

> Time must **never dominate quality** scoring.

---

## 6. Performance Score (PS)

Each game produces a **Performance Score (0–100)**.

### Formula

```
PS =
(Accuracy × 0.55)
+ (100 − Blunders × 15)
+ (100 − Mistakes × 7)
+ (TimeScore × 0.10)
```

### Interpretation

| PS     | Meaning           |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| 85–100 | Excellent         |
| 70–84  | Strong            |
| 50–69  | Average           |
| <50    | Needs improvement |

---

## 7. Rating Calculation Logic

### 7.1 Base Rating Change

Uses Elo-style expectation:

```
BaseDelta = K × (Result − ExpectedScore)
```

| Player Rating | K Factor |
| ------------- | -------- |
| <1000         | 32       |
| 1000–1600     | 24       |
| >1600         | 16       |

---

### 7.2 Performance Modifier

```
FinalRatingChange = BaseDelta × (0.5 + PS / 100)
```

**Effect**

* Strong play amplifies gain or softens loss
* Weak play limits gain even after win

---

## 8. Draw Button – Strategic Risk/Reward

### 8.1 Design Intent

Teach:

* When to push for a win
* When a draw is success
* Strategic decision-making

This is a **differentiator for Chess99**.

---

### 8.2 Position Evaluation

Primary:

* Engine evaluation (centipawns)

Fallback:

* Material balance
* King safety
* Pawn structure

| Eval         | Meaning          |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| > +1.0       | Player is better |
| −1.0 to +1.0 | Equal            |
| < −1.0       | Player is worse  |

---

### 8.3 Draw Outcome Rules (Rated Mode)

| Situation                    | Effect         |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| Better position accepts draw | Rating penalty |
| Worse position accepts draw  | Rating gain    |
| Equal position               | Minor ±        |
| Draw declined                | No effect      |
