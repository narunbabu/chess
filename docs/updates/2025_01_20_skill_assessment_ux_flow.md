## 🧪 Assessment Questions

### Question 1: Experience Level
| Option | Text | Starting Rating |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| 1 | Complete beginner - I just learned the rules | 800 |
| 2 | Casual player - I play occasionally for fun | 1200 |
| 3 | Club player - I play regularly and know basic strategies | 1600 |
| 4 | Tournament player - I compete in rated tournaments | 2000 |
| 5 | Expert player - I have significant competitive experience | 2400 |

### Question 2: Opening & Tactics Knowledge
| Option | Text | Rating Contribution |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| 1 | Not familiar - I play by intuition only | 800 |
| 2 | Basic knowledge - I know a few common openings | 1200 |
| 3 | Moderate knowledge - I study openings and practice tactics | 1600 |
| 4 | Advanced knowledge - I regularly study chess theory | 2000 |
| 5 | Expert knowledge - I deeply analyze games and theory | 2400 |

### Question 3: Engine Performance
| Option | Text | Rating Contribution |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| 1 | I lose to beginner bots (Level 1-3) | 800 |
| 2 | I can beat beginner bots but struggle with intermediate (Level 4-6) | 1200 |
| 3 | I can beat intermediate bots (Level 7-10) | 1600 |
| 4 | I can beat advanced bots (Level 11-14) | 2000 |
| 5 | I can beat expert-level bots (Level 15+) | 2400 |

**Calculation**: Final rating = Average of 3 answers (rounded)

**Examples**:
- Answers: [800, 1200, 800] → Rating: 933
- Answers: [1600, 1600, 1600] → Rating: 1600
- Answers: [2000, 1600, 2000] → Rating: 1867

## 🎮 Game Compatibility

### ✅ Games Work Without Assessment

**Default Behavior**:
- New users get 1200 rating from database migration
- PlayComputer.js uses `user.rating || 1200`
- PlayMultiplayer.js uses actual user rating for difficulty scaling
- All game logic handles default rating gracefully

**Rating Field**:
```sql
-- From migration
$table->integer('rating')->default(1200);
$table->boolean('is_provisional')->default(true);
$table->integer('games_played')->default(0);
```

**Frontend Usage**:
```javascript
// Always works, even without assessment
const userRating = user?.rating || 1200;
const engineLevel = calculateEngineLevelFromRating(userRating);
```

---

## 📊 Rating Prompt Logic

### When Banner Shows
```javascript
shouldShowRatingPrompt =
  user.rating === 1200 AND
  (user.games_played === 0 OR user.games_played is null)
```

### When Banner Hides
- User has custom rating (not 1200)
- User has played at least 1 game
- User dismissed/completed assessment

**Example States**:

| Rating | Games Played | Shows Banner? | Reason |
|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| 1200 | 0 | ✅ Yes | Default, no games |
| 1200 | 5 | ❌ No | Has played games |
| 1500 | 0 | ❌ No | Custom rating set |
| 1800 | 10 | ❌ No | Experienced user |

const [isNewRegistration, setIsNewRegistration] = useState(false);
```

### Dashboard.js States
```javascript
const [showSkillAssessment, setShowSkillAssessment] = useState(false);

## 🚀 API Integration

### Endpoint Called
```
POST /api/rating/initial
```

### Request Body
```json
{
  "rating": 1600
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Initial rating set successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "rating": 1600,
    "is_provisional": true,
    "games_played": 0
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
