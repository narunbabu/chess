# Complete Rating System Implementation

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Computer + Multiplayer)

---

## Overview

Comprehensive ELO rating system that updates user ratings after every game (computer and multiplayer) and displays rating changes on the game completion card.

---

## Rating Formula

### ELO Rating Calculation

```
Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((OpponentRating - PlayerRating) / 400))

K-Factor = {
  40 if games_played < 10     (new players - fast adjustment)
  30 if games_played < 30     (intermediate players)
  24 if rating >= 2400        (high-rated players)
  20 otherwise                (experienced players)
}

Rating Change = K × (Actual Score - Expected Score)

New Rating = Old Rating + Rating Change
```

### Actual Score Values
- Win: 1.0
- Draw: 0.5
- Loss: 0.0

### Rating Bounds
- Minimum: 400
- Maximum: 3200

---

## Backend Implementation

### API Endpoint: `/api/rating/update`

**File:** `chess-backend/app/Http/Controllers/RatingController.php`

**Request Payload:**
```json
{
  "opponent_rating": 1500,
  "result": "win|draw|loss",
  "game_type": "computer|multiplayer",
  "computer_level": 8,      // For computer games (1-16)
  "opponent_id": 123,       // For multiplayer games
  "game_id": 456
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "old_rating": 1450,
    "new_rating": 1475,
    "rating_change": 25,
    "games_played": 15,
    "is_provisional": true,
    "peak_rating": 1500,
    "k_factor": 30,
    "expected_score": 0.64,
    "actual_score": 1.0
  }
}
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ ELO formula implementation with K-factor adjustment
- ✅ Support for both computer (16 levels) and multiplayer games
- ✅ Rating history tracking with game details
- ✅ Peak rating tracking
- ✅ Provisional rating status (< 10 games)

---

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. Computer Rating Levels (16 Levels)

**File:** `chess-frontend/src/utils/eloUtils.js`

```javascript
export const COMPUTER_LEVEL_RATINGS = {
  1: 400,   // Complete Beginner
  2: 600,   // Novice
  3: 800,   // Learning
  4: 1000,  // Casual Player
  5: 1200,  // Intermediate
  6: 1400,  // Club Player
  7: 1600,  // Strong Club
  8: 1800,  // Expert
  9: 2000,  // Advanced Expert
  10: 2200, // Master
  11: 2400, // International Master
  12: 2600, // Grandmaster
  13: 2750, // Strong GM
  14: 2900, // Super GM
  15: 3050, // Elite
  16: 3200  // Maximum Strength
};
```

**Functions:**
- `getRatingFromLevel(level)` - Maps level to rating
- `calculateNewRating(currentRating, opponentRating, result, gamesPlayed)` - Client-side prediction
- `getRatingCategory(rating)` - Returns category, color, and label
- `formatRatingChange(change)` - Formats with +/- sign

---

### 2. Rating Service

**File:** `chess-frontend/src/services/ratingService.js`

```javascript
export const updateRating = async (ratingData) => {
  const response = await api.post('/api/rating/update', ratingData);
  return response.data;
};
```

---

### 3. Game Completion Animation Component

**File:** `chess-frontend/src/components/GameCompletionAnimation.js`

**Props:**
```javascript
{
  result,              // Game result object
  playerColor,         // 'white' or 'black'
  isMultiplayer,       // true for multiplayer, false for computer
  computerLevel,       // 1-16 for computer games
  opponentRating,      // Opponent's rating for multiplayer
  opponentId,          // Opponent's ID for multiplayer
  gameId,              // Game ID for history
  onClose,
  onNewGame,
  onBackToLobby,
  onPreview
}
```

**Auto Rating Update Logic:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isAuthenticated || !user) return;

  const gameResult = isPlayerWin ? 'win' : (isDraw ? 'draw' : 'loss');

  let ratingData = { result: gameResult };

  if (isMultiplayer) {
    // Multiplayer game
    ratingData = {
      ...ratingData,
      opponent_rating: opponentRating,
      game_type: 'multiplayer',
      opponent_id: opponentId,
      game_id: gameId,
    };
  } else {
    // Computer game
    const computerRating = getRatingFromLevel(computerLevel);
    ratingData = {
      ...ratingData,
      opponent_rating: computerRating,
      game_type: 'computer',
      computer_level: computerLevel,
      game_id: gameId,
    };
  }

  const response = await updateRating(ratingData);
  // Display rating change
}, [isAuthenticated, user, isPlayerWin, isDraw, ...]);
```

**Display Format:**
```
Rating: 1450 (+25) → 1475
```

## Integration in Game Components

### Computer Games

**File:** `chess-frontend/src/components/play/PlayComputer.js`

```javascript
<GameCompletionAnimation
  result={result}
  playerColor={playerColor}
  isMultiplayer={false}
  computerLevel={computerDepth}  // 1-16
  gameId={savedGameHistoryId}
  onClose={handleClose}
/>
```

**Status:** ✅ Already implemented

---

### Multiplayer Games

**File:** `chess-frontend/src/components/play/PlayMultiplayer.js`

**FIXED:** Added missing rating props (lines 2617-2629)

```javascript
<GameCompletionAnimation
  result={gameResult}
  playerColor={gameInfo.playerColor}
  isMultiplayer={true}
  opponentRating={
    gameInfo.playerColor === 'white'
      ? gameResult.black_player?.rating
      : gameResult.white_player?.rating
  }
  opponentId={
    gameInfo.playerColor === 'white'
      ? gameResult.black_player?.id
      : gameResult.white_player?.id
  }
  gameId={gameId}
  onClose={handleClose}
  onNewGame={handleNewGame}
  onBackToLobby={handleBackToLobby}
  onPreview={handlePreview}
/>
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed in this update

## Example Rating Calculations

### Example 1: New Player Beats Computer Level 5
- Player Rating: 1200 (5 games played)
- Computer Level: 5 (Rating: 1200)
- Result: Win
- K-Factor: 40 (< 10 games)
- Expected Score: 0.50
- Rating Change: 40 × (1.0 - 0.50) = +20
- New Rating: 1220

### Example 2: Experienced Player Loses to Computer Level 10
- Player Rating: 1800 (50 games played)
- Computer Level: 10 (Rating: 2200)
- Result: Loss
- K-Factor: 20 (≥ 30 games)
- Expected Score: 0.09
- Rating Change: 20 × (0.0 - 0.09) = -2
- New Rating: 1798

### Example 3: Multiplayer Draw
- Player A Rating: 1500 (20 games)
- Player B Rating: 1600 (30 games)
- Result: Draw
- K-Factor: 30 (Player A), 20 (Player B)
- Player A Expected: 0.36, Change: 30 × (0.5 - 0.36) = +4 → 1504
- Player B Expected: 0.64, Change: 20 × (0.5 - 0.64) = -3 → 1597

## API Routes

```php
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum'])->group(function () {
    Route::post('/api/rating/update', [RatingController::class, 'updateRating']);
    Route::get('/api/rating', [RatingController::class, 'getRating']);
    Route::get('/api/rating/history', [RatingController::class, 'getRatingHistory']);
    Route::get('/api/rating/leaderboard', [RatingController::class, 'getLeaderboard']);
});
```

---

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Authentication required via Sanctum
- ✅ User can only update their own rating
- ✅ Rating bounds enforced (400-3200)
- ✅ K-factor calculated server-side (not trusted from client)
- ✅ Expected score calculated server-side
- ✅ Rating history immutable once created

---

## Performance Considerations

- Rating calculation: O(1) - simple arithmetic
- Database writes: Single insert per game
- Frontend: Auto-updates on game completion
- Caching: Not required for rating updates

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rating Graph** - Visualize rating over time
2. **Pre-Game Rating Preview** - Show expected rating changes before game starts
3. **Recommended Level** - Suggest optimal computer difficulty based on rating
4. **Achievement System** - Badges for rating milestones
5. **Separate Leaderboards** - Computer vs multiplayer ratings
6. **Rating Categories UI** - Visual indicators for Beginner/Expert/Master etc.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered:

1. **Revert Multiplayer Changes:**
   ```bash
   git checkout HEAD -- chess-frontend/src/components/play/PlayMultiplayer.js
   ```

2. **System will gracefully degrade:**
   - Computer games: Rating updates will continue working
   - Multiplayer games: Will fall back to no rating display (but won't crash)

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ ELO rating formula implemented correctly
- ✅ K-factor adjusts based on experience
- ✅ Computer games (16 levels) update ratings
- ✅ Multiplayer games update ratings
- ✅ Rating change displayed on game completion card
- ✅ Rating history tracked in database
- ✅ Peak rating tracked
- ✅ Provisional status works
- ⏳ **End-to-end testing required**

---

**Implementation Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Ready for Testing:** 🧪 **YES**
