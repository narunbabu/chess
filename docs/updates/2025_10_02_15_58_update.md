# Update Log: HTTPS/SSL Production Deployment

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Type**: Infrastructure & Security Enhancement
**Scope**: Production deployment system

---

## Context

Implemented comprehensive HTTPS/SSL security for the Chess-Web production environment, including automated certificate management, secure WebSocket connections, and deployment workflow improvements.

## Changes Summary

### 1. SSL/TLS Certificate Setup
- **Frontend (chess99.com)**: Let's Encrypt SSL certificate with auto-renewal
- **Backend (api.chess99.com)**: Let's Encrypt SSL certificate with auto-renewal
- **Auto-Renewal**: Configured systemd timer for automatic certificate renewal
- **HTTP Redirect**: Automatic 301 redirect from HTTP to HTTPS

### 2. Nginx Configuration
- Enhanced security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options)
- TLS 1.2/1.3 protocol support
- Secure WebSocket (WSS) proxy configuration
- Optimized SSL cipher suites

### 3. Deployment Automation
- Fixed GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Updated deployment script (`deploy.sh`)
- Resolved `npm ci` package-lock.json sync issues
- Changed to `npm install` for more flexible dependency resolution

### 4. Frontend Configuration
- Updated `.env.production` for HTTPS API endpoints
- Configured secure WebSocket connection (WSS)
- Rebuilt production bundle with HTTPS settings

## Files Modified

```
.github/workflows/deploy.yml    # Fixed npm ci â†’ npm install
deploy.sh                        # Updated pnpm â†’ npm, fixed dependencies
docs/success-stories/2025_10_02_15_58_https_ssl_deployment.md  # Success story
docs/updates/2025_10_02_15_58_update.md  # This file
```

## Diff Summary

### `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```diff
- npm ci
+ npm install
```
**Reason**: Resolves package-lock.json sync issues during deployment

### `deploy.sh`
```diff
- pnpm install --prod
- pnpm build
+ npm install
+ npm run build
```
**Reason**: Standardize on npm for consistency with GitHub Actions workflow

## Risk Assessment

### Security Improvements âœ…
- **High**: All traffic now encrypted (TLS 1.2/1.3)
- **High**: HSTS prevents downgrade attacks
- **Medium**: Auto-renewal prevents certificate expiration

### Deployment Risks ðŸŸ¡
- **Low**: Package manager change (pnpm â†’ npm) tested successfully
- **Low**: Lock file generation during deployment (acceptable for this use case)
- **Mitigation**: Deployment script includes error handling and rollback capability

## Testing Performed

### SSL/TLS Verification
```bash
âœ… curl -sI https://chess99.com â†’ HTTP/1.1 200 OK
âœ… curl -sI https://api.chess99.com/api/health â†’ HTTP/1.1 200 OK
âœ… curl -sI http://chess99.com â†’ 301 Redirect to HTTPS
âœ… curl -sI http://api.chess99.com â†’ 301 Redirect to HTTPS
```

### WebSocket Testing
```bash
âœ… WSS connection established successfully
âœ… Real-time game invitations working
âœ… Laravel Reverb WebSocket server responding
```

### Deployment Testing
```bash
âœ… GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push
âœ… SSH connection successful
âœ… Code pulled and built successfully
âœ… Services restarted without errors
âœ… Health endpoints responding
```

## Completed Checklist

- [x] SSL certificates issued for chess99.com and www.chess99.com
- [x] SSL certificate issued for api.chess99.com
- [x] HTTP â†’ HTTPS redirect configured
- [x] HSTS headers enabled
- [x] Secure WebSocket (WSS) configured
- [x] Frontend .env.production updated for HTTPS
- [x] Frontend rebuilt with HTTPS configuration
- [x] Auto-renewal configured and tested
- [x] Firewall rules updated (UFW allow Nginx Full)
- [x] Deployment workflow fixed (npm ci â†’ npm install)
- [x] Deployment script updated (pnpm â†’ npm)
- [x] All services tested and verified
- [x] Documentation created (success story)
- [x] Health checks passing

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Certificate Monitoring
- **Auto-Renewal**: Systemd timer runs twice daily
- **Renewal Window**: 30 days before expiration
- **Verification**: `sudo certbot renew --dry-run`

### Health Checks
- Frontend: `https://chess99.com` â†’ 200 OK
- Backend: `https://api.chess99.com/api/health` â†’ 200 OK
- WebSocket: WSS connection active

### Log Locations
- Nginx logs: `/var/log/nginx/error.log`
- Certbot logs: `/var/log/letsencrypt/`
- Laravel logs: `/opt/Chess-Web/chess-backend/storage/logs/`

## Next Steps

1. âœ… HTTPS fully deployed and operational
2. ðŸ”„ Monitor certificate auto-renewal (next renewal in ~60 days)
3. ðŸ“Š Consider adding SSL monitoring (e.g., SSL Labs scan)
4. ðŸ”’ Optional: Add CSP headers for additional security
5. ðŸ“ˆ Optional: Configure OCSP stapling for performance
