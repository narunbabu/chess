# Phase 1 Migration Files Created

**Date:** 2025-10-03 10:00
**Phase:** Database Normalization (Phase 1)
**Status:** Migration files created, ready for execution
**Risk Level:** Low (additive changes only, reversible)

---

## Context

Fixing production errors caused by ENUM value mismatches between database schema and application code:
- Database has: `status ENUM('waiting','active','finished','aborted')`
- Application sends: `'abandoned'`, `'killed'` → causes "Data truncated" errors
- Goal: Normalize to FK lookup tables for single source of truth

---

## Changes Made

### Files Created

1. **`database/migrations/2025_10_03_100000_create_game_status_tables.php`**
   - Creates `game_statuses` lookup table with 4 canonical statuses
   - Creates `game_end_reasons` lookup table with 9 canonical reasons
   - Seeds both tables with initial values

2. **`database/migrations/2025_10_03_100001_add_status_fk_to_games.php`**
   - Adds `status_id` FK column to `games` table
   - Adds `end_reason_id` FK column to `games` table
   - Backfills FK values from existing ENUM columns
   - Validates backfill completeness before making `status_id` required

3. **`docs/tasks/2025_10_03_status_normalization.md`**
   - Project tracking document with all 4 phases outlined
   - Canonical value reference tables
   - Legacy value mapping guide
   - Rollback procedures

4. **`docs/tasks/2025_10_03_phase1_tests.md`**
   - Windows PowerShell-compatible test instructions
   - Pre-migration checks and database backup procedure
   - Post-migration verification tests (8 steps)
   - Rollback procedures for failure scenarios
   - Troubleshooting guide

## Migration Strategy

### Dual-Write Approach
- Old ENUM columns remain during transition (Phases 1-3)
- New FK columns added alongside
- Both columns kept in sync via model mutators (Phase 2)
- Old columns dropped only in Phase 4 (after 1 week verification)

### Safety Measures
1. **Nullable initially**: FK columns start nullable for safe backfill
2. **Validation check**: Migration fails if backfill incomplete
3. **Reversible**: Each migration has working `down()` method
4. **Foreign keys**: Enforce referential integrity with `restrict` on delete

## Canonical Values Established

### Game Statuses (4 values)
```
waiting  → Waiting for opponent
active   → In progress
finished → Finished
aborted  → Aborted
```

### End Reasons (9 values)
```
checkmate              → Checkmate
resignation            → Resignation
stalemate              → Stalemate
timeout                → Timeout
draw_agreed            → Draw by agreement
threefold              → Threefold repetition
fifty_move             → Fifty-move rule
insufficient_material  → Insufficient material
aborted                → Game aborted
```

## Testing Required

**Before proceeding to Phase 2:**

1. **Backup database** (critical safety step)
2. **Run migrations** with `php artisan migrate --force`
3. **Verify backfill** (0 null `status_id` values)
4. **Validate FK constraints** created correctly
5. **Check data integrity** (old values match new FK codes)

**Test File:** `docs/tasks/2025_10_03_phase1_tests.md`

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Execute Phase 1 tests (see test file)
2. ⏳ Create PHP enums (Phase 2.1)
3. ⏳ Create lookup models (Phase 2.2)
4. ⏳ Update Game model with dual-write (Phase 2.3)
5. ⏳ Update services and controllers (Phase 2.4-2.5)

---

## Rollback Plan

**If migration fails:**
```powershell
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=1  # Reverts last migration
php artisan migrate:rollback --step=2  # Reverts both Phase 1 migrations
```

**If database corrupted:**
```powershell
mysql -u root -p chess_production < ".\backups\chess_backup_TIMESTAMP.sql"
```

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Backfill fails (unmapped values) | Medium | High | Migration validates and fails early |
| FK constraint violation | Low | Medium | Backfill uses INNER JOIN to ensure valid refs |
| Production downtime | Low | High | Migrations are fast (<5 sec), reversible |
| Data loss | Very Low | Critical | Database backup required before execution |

---

## Performance Impact

- **Migration time:** ~2-5 seconds (depends on games table size)
- **Downtime:** None (additive changes)
- **Storage:** +2 bytes per game row (`status_id` + `end_reason_id`)
- **Query performance:** Negligible (indexed FK columns)
