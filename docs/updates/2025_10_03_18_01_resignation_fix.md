# Resignation Broadcasting Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-03 18:01
**Type:** Real-time Broadcasting Enhancement
**Related:** Moves Broadcasting Fix (2025_10_03_18_01_moves_broadcasting_fix.md)

---

## Summary

Fixed resignation feature to broadcast events in real-time, matching the behavior of move events. Previously, resignations would only return HTTP 200 success but wouldn't notify the opponent via WebSocket.

---

## Root Cause

1. **Missing Event Dispatch**
   - `GameController::resign()` updated database but never dispatched `GameEndedEvent`
   - Opponent browser never received notification of game end

2. **Queued Broadcasting**
   - `GameEndedEvent` used `ShouldBroadcast` (queued)
   - Production has no queue worker running
   - Events stuck in queue, never delivered

3. **Schema Inconsistency**
   - Code used `status = 'completed'` but schema defines ENUM: 'waiting', 'active', 'finished', 'aborted'
   - Code used `result = 'black_wins'` but schema expects PGN format: '1-0', '0-1', '1/2-1/2', '*'

---

## Changes Made

### 1. GameEndedEvent.php
**Changed from queued to immediate broadcasting:**

```php
// Before
use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcast;
class GameEndedEvent implements ShouldBroadcast

// After
use Illuminate\Contracts\Broadcasting\ShouldBroadcastNow;
class GameEndedEvent implements ShouldBroadcastNow
```

**Impact:** Events now broadcast synchronously, bypassing queue system

---

### 2. GameController.php
**Added event import:**
```php
use App\Events\GameEndedEvent;
```

**Rewrote resign() method:**

**Before:**
```php
public function resign($id)
{
    $game = Game::find($id);
    // ... validation ...

    $game->update([
        'status' => 'completed',
        'result' => $userColor === 'white' ? 'black_wins' : 'white_wins'
    ]);

    return response()->json(['message' => 'Game resigned', 'game' => $game]);
}
```

**After:**
```php
public function resign($id)
{
    $game = Game::find($id);
    // ... validation ...

    $userColor = $game->getPlayerColor($user->id);
    $winnerColor = $userColor === 'white' ? 'black' : 'white';
    $winnerId = $winnerColor === 'white' ? $game->white_player_id : $game->black_player_id;

    // Update with all resignation details
    $game->update([
        'status' => 'finished',                                    // ✅ Matches schema ENUM
        'result' => $userColor === 'white' ? '0-1' : '1-0',      // ✅ PGN format
        'end_reason' => 'resignation',                            // ✅ Proper end reason
        'winner_user_id' => $winnerId,                           // ✅ Winner tracking
        'winner_player' => $winnerColor,                         // ✅ Color tracking
        'ended_at' => now()                                      // ✅ Timestamp
    ]);

    $game->load(['whitePlayer', 'blackPlayer']);

    // Broadcast event to both players
    broadcast(new GameEndedEvent($game->id, [
        'game_over' => true,
        'result' => $game->result,
        'end_reason' => 'resignation',
        'winner_user_id' => $winnerId,
        'winner_player' => $winnerColor,
        'fen_final' => $game->fen,
        'move_count' => count($game->moves ?? []),
        'ended_at' => $game->ended_at->toISOString(),
        'white_player' => [
            'id' => $game->whitePlayer->id,
            'name' => $game->whitePlayer->name
        ],
        'black_player' => [
            'id' => $game->blackPlayer->id,
            'name' => $game->blackPlayer->name
        ]
    ]));

    return response()->json(['message' => 'Game resigned successfully', 'game' => $game]);
}
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Broadcasts `GameEndedEvent` to both players
- ✅ Sets all game end fields properly
- ✅ Uses correct schema values ('finished', '1-0'/'0-1')
- ✅ Includes detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Sends complete game data with player info

---

## Database Schema Verification

**games table migration (2025_09_27_124000_create_games_table.php):**

✅ `end_reason` ENUM includes 'resignation' (line 32)
✅ `winner_user_id` exists (line 42)
✅ `winner_player` ENUM('white', 'black') exists (line 24)
✅ `ended_at` timestamp exists (line 29)
✅ `status` ENUM: 'waiting', 'active', 'finished', 'aborted' (line 22)
✅ `result` VARCHAR(7): '1-0', '0-1', '1/2-1/2', '*' (line 23)

**No migration needed** - schema already supports all required fields.

## Deployment Steps

### On Production Server:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /var/www/chessab.site

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin master

# 3. Clear all caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear

# 4. Recache configuration
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache

# 5. Restart Reverb (to reload event classes)
sudo systemctl restart laravel-reverb

# 6. Verify Reverb is running
sudo systemctl status laravel-reverb
journalctl -u laravel-reverb -n 20

# 7. Check Laravel logs
tail -n 50 storage/logs/laravel.log
```

---

## Testing Procedure

### Manual Test:

1. **Setup:**
   - Open 2 browser tabs (or different browsers)
   - Log in as Player 1 in tab A
   - Log in as Player 2 in tab B
   - Start a game between them

2. **Test Resignation:**
   - In tab A, click "Resign" button
   - Observe both tabs

3. **Expected Results:**
   - ✅ Tab A: HTTP 200 response "Game resigned successfully"
   - ✅ Tab A: WebSocket event received (game.ended)
   - ✅ Tab B: WebSocket event received (game.ended)
   - ✅ Both tabs: UI updates showing game over
   - ✅ Both tabs: Correct winner displayed
   - ✅ Both tabs: End reason shown as "resignation"

4. **DevTools Verification:**
   ```
   Network → WS → Messages:

   ← subscription_succeeded (private-game.{id})
   ← game.ended {
        game_id: X,
        game_over: true,
        result: "1-0" or "0-1",
        end_reason: "resignation",
        winner_user_id: Y,
        winner_player: "white" or "black",
        white_player: {...},
        black_player: {...}
      }
   ```

5. **Server Logs Verification:**
   ```bash
   tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i "resign\|game.*ended"
   ```

   Expected:
   ```
   Broadcasting GameEndedEvent for resignation
   {
     "game_id": X,
     "result": "1-0",
     "winner_user_id": Y,
     "end_reason": "resignation"
   }
   ```

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

```bash
# 1. Revert code changes
git revert <commit-hash>

# 2. Clear caches
php artisan config:clear
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:cache

# 3. Restart Reverb
sudo systemctl restart laravel-reverb
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Queue Workers Not Running**
   - Currently using `ShouldBroadcastNow` to bypass queues
   - Future: Consider setting up queue workers for production
   - Alternative: Keep using `ShouldBroadcastNow` for critical events

2. **Status Value Inconsistency**
   - Some code still references 'completed' status
   - Should audit codebase and standardize on schema values
   - See: GameRoomService.php line 548

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Queue Worker Setup** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Create systemd service for queue worker
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/laravel-queue.service

   # Enable and start
   sudo systemctl enable laravel-queue
   sudo systemctl start laravel-queue
   ```

2. **Event Broadcasting Monitoring**
   - Add metrics for broadcast success/failure rates
   - Monitor Reverb connection stability
   - Track event delivery latency

3. **Code Audit**
   - Search for 'completed' status references
   - Standardize on schema-defined values
   - Update any remaining 'black_wins'/'white_wins' to PGN format
