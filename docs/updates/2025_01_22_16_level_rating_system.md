## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration runs successfully
- [ ] Computer game completion triggers rating update
- [ ] Rating change displays correctly in GameCompletionAnimation
- [ ] Rating history shows computer level correctly
- [ ] Multiplayer games still work (backward compatibility)
- [ ] Rating calculations are accurate for all 16 levels
- [ ] Rating history component loads and displays data
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works correctly

---

## User Experience Flow

1. **Game Setup**: Player selects difficulty level (1-16)
2. **Gameplay**: Player completes game against computer
3. **Game End**: GameCompletionAnimation appears
4. **Rating Update**:
   - Shows "Calculating rating..." loading state
   - Calls rating API with computer level
   - Displays: `oldRating (+change) â†’ newRating`
5. **History**: Player can view detailed rating history in profile

---

## Technical Decisions

### Why 16 Levels?
- Provides granular difficulty progression
- Maps well to standard ELO ranges (400-3200)
- Allows for meaningful rating changes at all skill levels
- Matches common chess engine difficulty systems

### Rating Mapping Strategy
- Linear progression from 400 to 3200
- 200-point increments in middle ranges
- Smaller increments at extremes for fine-tuning
- Based on standard chess rating categories

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing multiplayer rating system unchanged
- `computer_level` field is nullable
- Game type differentiation maintained
- Legacy function names preserved in eloUtils

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Pre-Game Rating Preview**: Show expected rating changes before game starts
2. **Rating Graph**: Visualize rating progression over time
3. **Recommended Level**: Suggest optimal difficulty based on current rating
4. **Achievement System**: Badges for rating milestones
5. **Rating Leaderboards**: Separate leaderboards for computer vs multiplayer
