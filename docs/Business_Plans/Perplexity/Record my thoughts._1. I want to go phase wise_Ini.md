# Record my thoughts.

1. I want to go phase wise
Initial days, kids of friends, families. In community etc
Tie up with teaches of local schools ask them to nudge students to register on chess99.com. I need to add them on pay roles. How to compensate them need to be seen
Tie up with schools to include it in curriculum. Give a share to them
2. Advertisement
Youtube videos
Ads on youtube channels
Tv channels
Paper ads
Flexy in local areas
Add Indiannes. Make in India. Chess of India branding
3. Branding
Tie up with local leaders, educationalists, chess champions etc
Tournaments branding. Teaching of chess branding.
How it helps to improve logical thinking, how it helps in excelling in other subjects needs to be taught
Roping chess teachers
4. Revenue generation
First free, concentrate on registrations
Rope in teachers, friends and give them links with their code- if people join with their code- they will get compensated for it

As a best ceo give me concrete plan and steps. If i missed anything include them align with my Thoughts, understand the India's business, people and aspirations and give concrete plan as business developer.
Thanks for sharing your vision and initial strategy! To build a concrete, CEO-level phase-wise growth plan aligned with Indian business and social contexts, I’d like to clarify a few points:
Phase Timeline: How long do you expect each phase to last (Initial outreach, Ads, Branding, Revenue)? Weeks or months?
Budget: Do you have a set budget for each phase (especially for ads, branding, school partnerships)?
Geography Focus: Are you starting locally (your city/state) or going pan-India from day one?
Resources: Do you have team members for sales/outreach, content creation, or development?
Teacher Onboarding: Do you want to pay school teachers per registration, fixed stipend, or performance-based?
Missed Areas: Are you open to platform features like certification, WhatsApp integration, or AI bots being part of the growth plan?
Once I have this, I’ll prepare a refined and complete phase-wise business growth strategy tailored to India and your platform.
You said:

1. Weeks 2. Tell me budget estimates and suggest for which one how much i need to spend. Give me business plan too 3. Gradually- hyderabad, Andhra pradesh, Telangana and then Pan India 4. Presently i do not have others. Recruitment plan too I need 5. Performance based. This is side income for them 6. Yes. Pretty much

Perfect! Now let me create a final summary of what I've prepared for you.
