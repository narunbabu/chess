* Read `docs/context.md`; map the exact code paths you’ll touch (call graph, data flow, entry points), list constraints/invariants, and note any global/shared primitives implicated.
* While generating code for different pages/modules apply the principle of "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) by extracting repetitive logic into functions or methods, using inheritance and interfaces, and consolidating duplicated classes or methods. This improves maintainability, reduces bugs, and saves time. 
* Identify stakeholders (modules, services, users, jobs) and the public contracts they rely on; write down invariants and edge cases discovered in code, tests, and logs.
* Propose a short plan (goal, approach, files to change, rollout/flags, observability, risks, tests) and wait for approval before coding.
* Work in small, reversible slices behind feature flags; prefer additive code and local adapters over edits to shared primitives; include a kill-switch and default flags to off.
* Match existing styles for imports/exports, naming, logging (structured), error handling, i18n, and accessibility; copy nearby patterns rather than inventing new ones.
* Run a drift check before changes: align DB schema/migrations, server validators/types, and client constants/enums; document any mismatches and propose mapping/migration.
* Preserve public APIs and data schemas; if a change is unavoidable, provide compatibility shims/versioning, safe migrations, and a documented rollback plan with precise steps.
* Keep the build green locally: `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`; run migrations in dry-run/staging first and include seed/fixtures for new data.
* Write targeted tests for new/changed behavior, including flag-off and legacy paths; cover failure modes, boundary cases, and schema/validator parity; update snapshots intentionally.
* Exclude secrets/PII from code and logs; use env vars/secret manager; sanitize request/response logging; enforce authZ/authN and input validation on all new entry points.
* Monitor performance on likely hot paths; add lightweight metrics/timers; avoid N+1s, excessive allocations, and unnecessary async/await; include a simple perf budget in PR notes.
* **CRITICAL: Performance optimization must preserve functional correctness**; test all user flows after each optimization change, especially multi-step scenarios (e.g., multiple computer moves, form submissions, API calls); pay special attention to stateful resources (workers, WebSockets, caches, connections) - worker lifecycle, connection pooling, and cache invalidation are fragile and easy to break during refactoring; never assume optimization changes are "purely performance" - always validate core functionality; create explicit test scenarios before starting optimization work and check them after every change.
* Communicate high-level status after each slice (what/why/next/risks); call out assumptions and pause for re-approval if scope, contracts, or risk surface change.
* Execute TODO items incrementally; convert TODOs into trackable tasks where useful; check them off in the update note as they’re completed.
* Append a concise change log to `docs/updates/YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_update.md` (same timestamp as the TODO; “todo” → “update”) covering context, diff summary, risks, tests, rollout/flags, metrics, and links to PRs/dashboards.
* For each debug fix, add `docs/success-stories/YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_<slug>.md` with problem, root cause, resolution, impact, lessons learned, and links to PR/tests; link it from the corresponding update note.
* Use `pnpm` for Node workflows (`pnpm i`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`); keep the lockfile committed and avoid mixing package managers.
* Use clear conventional commits (`type(scope): summary`); reference issues, mention flags/migrations in the body, and make changesets easy to trace and revert.
* **MANDATORY: Always use PowerShell for all command execution**; all npm, pnpm, php, node, and system commands MUST be executed through `powershell.exe -Command "..."` format; NEVER use direct bash commands; example: `powershell.exe -Command "cd 'C:\\ArunApps\\Chess-Web\\chess-backend'; pnpm install"`; this applies to ALL commands without exception - build, test, install, deploy, migrations, etc.; use proper Windows path escaping with double backslashes (\\) and single quotes around paths with spaces; tests must be compatible to run in Windows PowerShell environment.
