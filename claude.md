1. First read the docs/context.md to understand the project and think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files. Read the last two solution_applied from the objects of history.json for latest changes.
2. If mentioned taks or todo list, then Check for latest todo file in tasks/ and given the user request work on the taks given in todo file. If you are asked to make plan, append plan name after timestamp yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_{plan_name}.md and keep it in tasks/
4. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
5. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
6. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
7. Make every task and code change you do as precise as possible. And avoid making any massive or complex changes. 
8. Keep/append a summary of the changes you made with task list marked as completed and any other relevant information in yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_update.md ("todo" replaced by "update" with same timestamp as todo file name)
9. Use pnpm if you want to run whenever npm commands
