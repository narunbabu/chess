1. First read the docs/context.md to understand the project and think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files. Read the last two solution_applied from the objects of history.json for latest changes.
2. Keep in mind all the related logic and the stake holders of codeblocks before constructing them. The new code blocks should be consistent with existing related codes (imports and where exports happen)
4. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
5. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
6. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
7. Make every task and code change you do as precise as possible. And avoid making any massive or complex changes. 
8. Keep/append a summary of the changes you made with task list marked as completed and any other relevant information in yyyy_mm_dd_hh_mm_update.md ("todo" replaced by "update" with same timestamp as todo file name)
9. Use pnpm if you want to run whenever npm commands
