# Lobby Navigation Fix - 2025-09-30

## Problem
When a player clicked "Go to Lobby" after a game ended, one account would re-open the chess board instead of staying in the lobby. The other account worked correctly.

### Symptoms
- Player 1 (White) clicked "Go to Lobby" → LobbyPage loaded → Auto-navigated back to game board
- Player 2 (Black) clicked "Go to Lobby" → Stayed in lobby correctly
- Console showed repeated "Navigating to game from accepted invitation" messages
- LobbyPage's auto-navigation logic was triggering even after intentional lobby visit

## Root Cause
**LobbyPage.js** had auto-navigation logic (lines 114-138) that automatically navigated users to games from accepted invitations. This logic didn't distinguish between:
1. **Automatic navigation** - When invitation is freshly accepted
2. **Intentional lobby return** - When user explicitly clicks "Go to Lobby" after game completion

The backend continued to return the accepted invitation with `status: 'accepted'` and associated `game_id`, triggering unwanted auto-navigation.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Clear Session Storage on "Go to Lobby" Click
**File:** `chess-frontend/src/components/play/PlayMultiplayer.js:741-752`

Added cleanup logic to clear invitation-related session data and set intentional visit flag:

```javascript
onBackToLobby={() => {
  // Clear invitation-related session storage to prevent auto-navigation
  sessionStorage.removeItem('lastInvitationAction');
  sessionStorage.removeItem('lastInvitationTime');
  sessionStorage.removeItem('lastGameId');

  // Set flag to indicate intentional lobby visit
  sessionStorage.setItem('intentionalLobbyVisit', 'true');
  sessionStorage.setItem('intentionalLobbyVisitTime', Date.now().toString());

  navigate('/lobby');
}}
```

### 2. Detect Intentional Lobby Visits
**File:** `chess-frontend/src/pages/LobbyPage.js:113-136`

Added detection logic to skip auto-navigation when user intentionally visits lobby:

```javascript
// Check if user intentionally visited the lobby
const intentionalVisit = sessionStorage.getItem('intentionalLobbyVisit') === 'true';
const intentionalVisitTime = parseInt(sessionStorage.getItem('intentionalLobbyVisitTime') || '0');
const timeSinceIntentionalVisit = Date.now() - intentionalVisitTime;

// If user intentionally visited lobby within the last 5 seconds, don't auto-navigate
if (intentionalVisit && timeSinceIntentionalVisit < 5000) {
  console.log('⚠️ Intentional lobby visit detected, skipping auto-navigation');

  // Clear the flag after processing
  sessionStorage.removeItem('intentionalLobbyVisit');
  sessionStorage.removeItem('intentionalLobbyVisitTime');

  // Mark any accepted invitations as processed
  // ... (marks invitations as processed)
}
```

### 3. Mark Finished Games to Prevent Re-Entry
**File:** `chess-frontend/src/components/play/PlayMultiplayer.js:104-111`

Added flag to mark games as finished:

```javascript
// Mark the related invitation as processed to prevent auto-navigation loop
const lastGameId = sessionStorage.getItem('lastGameId');
if (lastGameId === gameId.toString()) {
  sessionStorage.setItem('gameFinished_' + gameId, 'true');
  console.log('Game is finished, marked to prevent re-entry');
}
```

**File:** `chess-frontend/src/pages/LobbyPage.js:147-166`

Added check to prevent navigating to finished games:

```javascript
// Check if the game is already marked as finished
const gameId = acceptedData.game?.id;
const isGameFinished = sessionStorage.getItem('gameFinished_' + gameId) === 'true';

if (acceptedData.game && !processedInvitations.includes(invitationId) && !isGameFinished) {
  // Navigate to game
}
```

## Changes Summary

### Modified Files
1. **chess-frontend/src/components/play/PlayMultiplayer.js**
   - Added session storage cleanup on "Go to Lobby" button click
   - Added intentional lobby visit flag setting
   - Added finished game marker on initialization

2. **chess-frontend/src/pages/LobbyPage.js**
   - Added intentional lobby visit detection (5-second window)
   - Added finished game check to prevent navigation
   - Auto-marks invitations as processed on intentional lobby visit

## Testing
✅ Player 1 (White) clicks "Go to Lobby" → Stays in lobby
✅ Player 2 (Black) clicks "Go to Lobby" → Stays in lobby
✅ Both players can start new games without issues
✅ Auto-navigation still works for fresh invitations
✅ No more navigation loops

## Technical Details

### Session Storage Keys Used
- `intentionalLobbyVisit` - Boolean flag indicating user explicitly went to lobby
- `intentionalLobbyVisitTime` - Timestamp of intentional visit (5-second validity window)
- `gameFinished_<gameId>` - Boolean flag marking game as finished
- `lastInvitationAction` - Cleared on lobby return
- `lastInvitationTime` - Cleared on lobby return
- `lastGameId` - Cleared on lobby return
- `processedInvitations` - Array of processed invitation IDs

### Time Windows
- **Intentional lobby visit**: 5-second window to prevent auto-navigation
- **Game finish check**: Permanent until session cleared

## Todos Completed
✅ Clear session storage in PlayMultiplayer when navigating to lobby
✅ Add intentional lobby visit flag in LobbyPage
✅ Mark invitation as processed when returning from finished game
