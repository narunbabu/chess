# Invitation System Fix - September 29, 2025

## Problem Identified
- Invitations weren't synchronizing properly between users
- Invitation cancellation was failing with 404 errors
- Recipients weren't getting real-time updates when invitations were sent/cancelled
- Event class was incorrectly defined inside the controller

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Proper Event Classes
- **Created**: `app/Events/InvitationAccepted.php` - Broadcasts when invitation is accepted
- **Created**: `app/Events/InvitationSent.php` - Broadcasts when invitation is sent
- **Created**: `app/Events/InvitationCancelled.php` - Broadcasts when invitation is cancelled

### 2. Fixed InvitationController
- **Removed**: Incorrect event class definition from controller
- **Added**: Proper imports for event classes
- **Updated**: `send()` method to broadcast `InvitationSent` event
- **Updated**: `cancel()` method to broadcast `InvitationCancelled` event and load relationships
- **Improved**: Error messages and response handling

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Real-time Updates
- **Added**: Listener for `invitation.sent` events (recipients get immediate updates)
- **Added**: Listener for `invitation.cancelled` events (recipients see removal immediately)
- **Enhanced**: `handleCancelInvitation` with immediate state updates
- **Improved**: Error handling and user feedback

## Files Modified
1. `/chess-backend/app/Events/InvitationAccepted.php` (created)
2. `/chess-backend/app/Events/InvitationSent.php` (created)
3. `/chess-backend/app/Events/InvitationCancelled.php` (created)
4. `/chess-backend/app/Http/Controllers/InvitationController.php` (updated)
5. `/chess-frontend/src/pages/LobbyPage.js` (updated)

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **Sending Invitation**: Recipient immediately sees new invitation without page refresh
2. **Cancelling Invitation**:
   - Sender sees invitation removed immediately
   - Recipient sees invitation removed immediately
   - No more 404 errors
3. **Real-time Sync**: Both users stay synchronized without manual polling

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Send invitation from one account - check if recipient sees it immediately
- [ ] Cancel invitation from sender - check if both users see removal
- [ ] Accept invitation - check if game creates and navigation works
- [ ] Check browser console for WebSocket event logs
- [ ] Verify no 404 errors on cancellation

## Technical Implementation
- Uses Laravel Broadcasting with Reverb WebSocket server
- Private channels for user-specific notifications
- Proper event broadcasting to notify relevant parties
- Immediate state updates in frontend for better UX
