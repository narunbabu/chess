● ✅ All Issues Fixed and Enhanced!

  I've successfully implemented comprehensive fixes for game end detection, WebSocket communication, points        
  calculation, and user experience. Here's what was accomplished:

  🔧 Critical Fixes Implemented

  1. Fixed GameEndedEvent Broadcasting Bug
  - CRITICAL: Removed ->toOthers() so BOTH players receive the game end event
  - Before: Player who made winning move didn't get the event
  - After: Both players receive GameEndedEvent simultaneously

  2. Enhanced Game End Data
  - Added player names (white_player, black_player) to GameEndedEvent
  - Updated GameEndedEvent to include all necessary data for proper display
  - Both players now see complete game information in end cards

  ⚡ Points System Integration

  3. Complete Points Calculation System
  - Player Moves: Real-time evaluation using advanced chess engine (evaluate.js)
  - Opponent Moves: Automatic evaluation of received moves
  - Score Display: Live updating scores with move classifications (Excellent, Good, etc.)
  - Server Integration: Move metrics sent to server for persistence

  Features Added:
  // Player moves evaluated with:
  - Material gains/losses
  - Positional improvements
  - Tactical elements (forks, pins, checks)
  - King safety and development
  - Time bonuses
  - Risk-reward analysis
  - Move classifications (Brilliant, Excellent, Good, etc.)

  4. Enhanced WebSocket Communication
  - Immediate Detection: Checkmate/stalemate detected on move execution
  - Reliable Broadcasting: Server broadcasts to ALL players (fixed toOthers issue)
  - Comprehensive Data: Game end events include player names, scores, reasons
  - Position Verification: Server validates position sync before accepting moves

  🎮 User Experience Improvements

  5. Enhanced Game End Cards
  - Player Names: Shows actual player names instead of generic text
  - Complete Results: Win/loss/draw with detailed reasons
  - Real-time Display: No refresh needed, instant result display
  - Consistent Data: Same information shown to both players

  6. Live Score Tracking
  - Real-time Updates: Points calculated and displayed for each move
  - Move Quality: Visual indicators (⭐ Excellent, ✓ Good, ❌ Mistake, etc.)
  - Dual Tracking: Both player and opponent scores tracked separately
  - Performance Metrics: Move timing and quality assessment

  🚀 Technical Implementation

  Frontend Changes:
  - ✅ Integrated evaluation system into PlayMultiplayer.js
  - ✅ Added score states and real-time calculation
  - ✅ Fixed ScoreDisplay component props
  - ✅ Enhanced move data with metrics and evaluation
  - ✅ Added opponent move evaluation on receive

  Backend Changes:
  - ✅ Fixed critical ->toOthers() broadcasting bug
  - ✅ Added player names to GameEndedEvent data
  - ✅ Enhanced validation for move metrics
  - ✅ Improved game finalization with client-provided data
  - ✅ Server-side position verification and sync

  🎯 Game Flow Now Works As Expected

  1. Move Execution: Player makes move → Points calculated → Sent to server
  2. Server Processing: Position verified → Move stored → GameEndedEvent if checkmate
  3. Broadcasting: Event sent to BOTH players with complete data
  4. UI Response: Both players see game end cards with names, scores, results
  5. Score Updates: Live score tracking throughout the game
