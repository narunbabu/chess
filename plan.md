| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Freemium Core**          | Unlimited casual play vs. entry-level AI; 50 daily stars cap.                                            |
| **Premium Pass (₹299/mo)** | • Advanced bots to 2500 Elo  • Unlimited puzzles  • Season pass cosmetics  • Parent deep-dive analytics. |
| **Star Packs (IAP)**       | 200 stars ₹79 → cosmetics, wheel spins, tournament tickets.                                              |
| **Sponsored Tournaments**  | Monthly brand-backed events; free for kids, ad banner on lobby.                                          |

## 5  Safety & Compliance

* **COPPA / GDPR-K**: collect birthday, store hashed; require verified parent e-mail if <13.
* **Chat Guardrails**: canned phrases + emoji; no free-text.
* **Image Avatars**: curated library—no uploads to avoid moderation burden.
* **Data Minimalism**: playstrings + anonymised user-ids for public leaderboards.

---


*Horizontal scaling:*

* WebSockets behind sticky-session load balancer.
* AI Tutor micro-service uses queue + GPU pool (Modal/RunPod autoscale).

## 7  Gamification & Engagement Tactics

1. **Streak Flames**: lose streak if no puzzle completed that day → gentle push notification.
2. **Seasonal Maps**: each quarter a new “world” board skin & themed quests (e.g., Space Chess).
3. **Boss Battles**: AI mentors with personalities (“Professor Pawn”, “Queen Fury”) unlockable after badge milestones.
4. **Friend Codes**: invite = both get 500 stars; track K-factor for referral virality.
5. **Real-World Badges**: mail limited-edition stickers after first tournament win (cost ₽, but boosts retention).

### Closing Note

Centre everything around **positive reinforcement** and **bite-size mastery**. You already own a concise playstring format—extend that same elegance to every service: store small, compute on demand, and surface wins instantly.

Once the MVP loop (Quest → Play → Reward) feels *fun* with zero friction for a 7-year-old, all other layers—monetization, advanced analytics, school rollout—stack naturally on top.
